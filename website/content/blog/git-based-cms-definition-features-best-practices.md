In this post, we'll dive into the definition, main features, caveats, and best practices of Git-based CMS, helping you make an informed decision for your next project.

### **What is a Git-Based CMS?**

A Git-based CMS, as the name suggests, enables you to edit content that is stored in your Git repository, alongside your code. It's an integral part of the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) architecture, which separates the frontend from data and business logic. In practice, this means you'll need:

- a static site generator or a meta-framework (like Hugo, Gatsby, Next),
- a headless CMS (either Git-based or API-based),
- a build & CDN platform (like Netlify or Vercel).

You can also think of a Git-based CMS as a visual editing layer on top of data files like Markdown, JSON, YAML, etc. This makes content management more intuitive for developers, as it brings content directly into your code editor.

### **Versioning: A Developer's Dream**

The standout feature of Git-based CMS is its robust versioning and history capability. It leverages [Git](https://git-scm.com/)'s powerful version control system, allowing you to restore exact states from various points in history. Moreover, Git-based CMS works seamlessly with branches and branch-related environments, making content editing and review a breeze. This aligns it with the workflows developers are familiar with for code changes.

### **Simplicity at Its Core**

While there may be differences among Git-based CMS options, they are generally straightforward to set up. For instance, Decap CMS can be integrated with just the addition of [two files](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/) to your repository. Storing content alongside your code makes it easily accessible for developers, eliminating the need to switch between code editors and tools like phpMyAdmin. The user interface for content editors is designed with a focus on content, simplifying their experience and leaving out unnecessary settings and styling options. Say goodbye to dependency alerts, as you might encounter in traditional CMS platforms like WordPress.

### **Scalability: From Small to Large Projects**

Git-based CMS solutions balance simplicity and scalability, making them suitable for a wide range of projects. Scalability largely depends on the volume of your content and the speed at which you need to serve it. For static site projects, Git-based CMS can go a long way. However, if you require instant search or other resource-intensive queries, you might want to consider an API-based solution.

Some Git-based CMS platforms like Tina and CloudCanon offer a cloud database proxy, enabling advanced features that might be necessary for specific projects. The scalability of your Git-based CMS will also depend on your Git provider, as the CMS consumes resources through their API when making commits. The decoupled nature of Git-stored content ensures that scaling your frontend to accommodate more users is a seamless process.

### **Enhanced Security and Business Flexibility**

With content stored alongside your code, the security landscape becomes simplified. You only need to secure a single source, and you can outsource this responsibility to your Git provider, such as GitHub or BitBucket. The CMS user interface can be further secured with the authentication service of your choice. Some Git-based CMS platforms even offer customizable logins, and others allow you to define an external or custom solution. Additionally, certain Git-based CMS platforms provide different roles for content editors, giving you fine-grained control over who can make changes.

From a business perspective, Git-based CMS solutions offer exceptional value, with many open-source options available. Numerous platforms provide free tier options that can be upgraded as your needs evolve. Importantly, you retain ownership of your content, which is stored in universally recognized formats like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This means you can easily switch to another CMS with minimal effort. Depending on your business requirements, you can choose from options like simple open-source solutions to more advanced options like DB proxies and real-time collaboration, each with its pricing structure.

### **Caveats to Consider**

As with any technology, there are caveats to keep in mind when using a Git-based CMS. Content managed through a Git-based CMS is typically project-specific and not recommended for cases where you have a central repository of content serving multiple frontend clients, such as a website and a mobile app. While Git providers offer fast and reliable APIs, very large repositories may experience performance issues. Some Git-based CMS platforms address this with a cloud database layer, which comes at an additional cost.

Moreover, Git is not ideal for storing large files like images efficiently. Although Git offers a feature known as Large File Storage (LFS), it's often more practical to use an external service such as [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to manage large assets. These services can be seamlessly integrated into your Git-based CMS, providing a more efficient way to handle media files.

### **Best Practices for Git-Based CMS Adoption**

When considering a Git-based CMS, it's crucial to approach it within the context of your entire tech stack. It's a fundamental part of the Jamstack architecture, so it's essential to plan your project accordingly. You can add a Git-based CMS later on or replace it, but having a clear understanding of your project's requirements from the start will simplify the process.

Research your options thoroughly, as there are numerous Git-based CMS platforms with different features. Ask yourself what you need and explore the combinations that align with your project's objectives. If you're migrating from a traditional database-driven CMS, you can find scripts online or ask for assistance to ease the transition.

### **In Conclusion**

Git-based CMS offers versioning, simplicity, and security, making it a joy to install, use, and maintain. It streamlines the CMS experience, reducing complexity and offering greater control over your content. In essence, itâ€™s the most of CMS for the least amount of moving parts.
